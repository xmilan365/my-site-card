# my-site-card
Easy personal site card that refers to another sites (github, strava, linkedin etc.)

I was experimentig a little with html, css and flask - the goal was just to create website hosted on github.

To have website hsoted on github - move main.html from template dir to main dir. If desired to host on local server using flask - main.html needs to be in template directory.
